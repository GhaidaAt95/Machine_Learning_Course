		- Matlab -- Numpy
			https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html
	- NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation
	- Two of NumPy’s features which are the basis of much of its power: vectorization and broadcasting.
		- vectorization :  Absence of a any explicit looping, indexing, etc. in the code. 
				- Happening "behind the scenes" in optimized, pre-compiled C code.
		- broadcasting : implicit element-by-element behavior of operations
